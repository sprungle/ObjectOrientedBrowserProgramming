# DungeonAdventure

WHAT THIS IS ABOUT?

This is a school exercise for me (a first year IT-student) to get familiar with Object Oriented Browser Programming. Idea is to create a story based game which allows player to make choices on how to proceed in the game. For example player can choose to move to another room in the dungeon, to look around or to attack an enemy. Insturctions for the exercise included that the code must be based on object oriented programming style.

ADDITIONAL INFO:

template.js refers to a file that was given by the instructing teached at the beginning of the assignment. It has the functionality for user interface, where player can browse action choices by pressing arrow up and down.

HOW TO RUN THIS?

To run this program: 

1. Progam runs in Node.js, so install the software from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2. Install Node Package Manager, command "npm install"

and 

3. Clone index.js to that same repository. 

4. Run the program with command "node index.js"

ALTERNATIVELY (instead of installing npm) you can clone "node_modules" and "package-lock.json" (saved under Exercise1).

HOW WAS THE PROJECT?

After completing the project I had one minor issue unsolved: game should end if the strenght of the player runs out after being attacked by enemies. I found a solution for this later on and now it has been fixed. My project was reviewed both by peer students and teacher and I was graded with 10/10 points. I enjoyed the task and learned the idea of object oriented programming.
